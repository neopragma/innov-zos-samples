### 1. Mass-Mailing Solution 

#### Back Story

Our company, a revered financial institution, sends unsolicited emails to unsuspecting people to advertise unwanted products.

It is a time-honored business model that everyone loves.

#### Application Overview 

We purchase mailing lists from three external suppliers, who send us sequential data sets we call _data feeds_
. 
We run a batch job that performs extract-transform-load (ETL) operations on the data feeds to produce a single sequential data set that contains contact information in a common format.

The job then processes that data set to update our system of record with new contacts and to set a "do not contact" indicator if requested.

Another batch job runs on a monthly basis. It looks for contacts in the system of record who have not received a mailing within the past month. If their "do not contact" indicator is not set, they are selected for the next mailing.

The next step in the job reads the selected contact records and sends the emails with fake "from" addresses, to foil blocklists.

Our customer service department uses a CICS application to browse the Contacts. Just like a real customer service department, they can't change anything in the system.

#### Skills to Demonstrate

The project offers the opportunity to demonstrate the following skills:

- Using ISPF panels to allocate data sets.
- Using SDSF to review batch job output.
- Writing JCL to run IBM utilities such as IEFBR14, IEBGENER, DFSORT, and IDCAMS.
- Writing DFSORT commands to reformat, sort, and merge data sets.
- Working with Generation Data Groups (GDGs).
- Conditional job step execution using either COND or IF/ELSE.
- Step restart after job failure, including handling Generation Data Sets correctly.
- Writing batch COBOL programs that access either DB2 or a VSAM KSDS, as well as sequential data sets.
- Writing COBOL logic to manipulate textual data and perform date arithmetic.
- Designing and coding a BMS mapset (full bootcamp only).
- Writing a COBOL program to access either DB2 or VSAM in the CICS environment (full bootcamp only).

#### System of Record 

The system of record for our solution contains Contact information.

Depending on the topics included in your training program, this will be either a DB2 database containing one table or a single VSAM Key-Sequenced Data Set (not both).

The data store for the system of record is _not_ provided. Creating it is part of the capstone exercise.

#### Batch Job #1 - Ingest Data Feeds 

The first batch job will comprise several steps to read data feeds in different formats, reformat them into a common format, normalize the names, sort the records and merge the files before updating the system of record with new and modified contact information. The number of job steps will depend on how you choose to design the solution. 

![Fig. 1: Ingest data feeds (overview)](Mailout_Fig_1.png)

The first few steps of the job must read the three data feeds and sort them. 

![Fig. 2: Read and sort 3 data feeds](Mailout_Fig_2.png)

_Data Feed #1_ 

Upload ```capstone/Mailout_Data_Feed_1.txt``` as ```<userid>.INNOV.FEED1```.

Data set type: PS (sequential)

Record format: Fixed, blocked 

Logical record length: 133 

Block size: Your choice

Record layout:

| Positions | Contents |
| ---       | ---      |
| 1 - 100   | Name - comma-delimited list of tokens. May contain: |
| |              first-name, last-name |
| |              first-name, middle-name, last-name |
| |              primer-nombre, segundo-nombre, primer-apellido, segundo-apellido | 
| |              if blank, it's an error | 
| |              if it contains fewer than 2 tokens or more than 4 tokens, it's an error |
| 101 - 132 | Email Address - could be invalid |
| 133 - 133 | Do Not Contact requested - any non-blank value | 

  This format contains no language indicator. Normalization logic must guess based on the number of tokens in the Name field 

_Data Feed #2_ 

Upload ```capstone/Mailout_Data_Feed_2.txt``` as ```<userid>.INNOV.FEED2```.

Data set type: PS (sequential)

Record format: Fixed, blocked

Record layout:

| Positions | Contents |
| ---       | ---      |
| 1 - 40    | Email address - could be invalid |
| 41 - 70   | Last name or primer apellido |
| 71 -100   | First name or primer nombre |
| 101 -130  | Middle name or segundo nombre or blank |

| 153 - 154 | Language code - "EN", "ES", or an erroneous value. If blank assume "EN". |

_Data Feed #3_

Upload ```capstone/Mailout_Data_Feed_3.txt``` as ```<userid>.INNOV.FEED3```.

Data set type: PS (sequential)

Record format: Fixed, blocked 

Logical record length: 151 

Block size: Your choice

Record layout:

| Positions | Contents |
| ---       | ---      |
| 1 - 40    | Last name or primer apellido |
| 41 - 80   | First name or primer nombre |
| 81 - 120  | Middle name or segundo nombre or "STOP" in positions 81 - 84. "STOP" is a request not to contact. In that case, middle name or segundo nombre is not provided. |
| 121 - 150 | Email address - could be invalid |
| 151 - 151 | Language code - "1" = English, "2" = Spanish. Could be invalid. Blank is an error. |

_Common Input Format (Result of reformatting)_

Data set type: PS (sequential)

Record format: Fixed, blocked 

Logical record length: 143 

Block size: Your choice

Record layout:

| Positions | Contents |
| ---       | ---      |
| 1 - 100   | Name as a single field with name elements in the same order as in Data Feed format #1, separated by one or more spaces. Name elements that contain embedded spaces are encloded in quotation marks. |
| 101 - 102 | Language code - "EN" = English, "ES" - Spanish, blank = undetermined |
| 103 - 142 | Email address |
| 143 - 143 | Do Not Contact requested - "R". Otherwise blank |



![Fig. 3: Rationalize names and guess the language if it is undetermined](Mailout_Fig_3.png)

Write a COBOL program to clean up the input data and write good records to a Generation Data Set. Write "bad" records to an error file.

For records with blanks in the language code field, guess the language based on the number of tokens in the name field. If there are four tokens, assume Spanish. Otherwise, assume English.


![Fig. 4: Apply updates to the system of record data store](Mailout_Fig_4.png)

Update either the VSAM KSDS or DB2 CONTACTS table based on the sorted, merged, and rationalized input data. 

Records that match on both email address and surname are deemed to be duplicates.

Our policy regarding "do not contact" indicators:

We do not set "do not contact" when we first receive a contact through our external suppliers. 
If the inbound record matches an existing contact in our system of record, then we check the "do not contact" request field in the input record. Our policy is not to set the "do not contact" indicator until the contact requests it twice. First time, we set it to "P"; second time, to "X".

| Input: DNC Requested | System of Record Current Value | System of Record New Value |
| ---                  | ---                            | ---                        |
| R                    | X                              | no change                  |
| R                    | P                              | X                          |
| R                    | not set                        | P                          |
| blank                | any                            | no change                  |

#### CICS application to query the system of record

If your bootcamp curriculum included CICS application development, then develop a BMS mapset and COBOL program to browse the system of record back end data store (either VSAM KSDS or DB2) and display the records. 

![Fig. : CICS application](Mailout_Fig_8.png)

It is not mandatory to write an update application for CICS, but feel free if you wish.
