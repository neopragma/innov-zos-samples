## COBOL samples

#### COBOL General Examples

- **[HELLO.cbl](HELLO.cbl)**. The canonical "Hello, World!" program in COBOL.

- **[NOTHING.cbl](NOTHING.cbl)**. The minimum program in COBOL.

- **[BSKEL1.cbl](BSKEL1.cbl)**. Batch COBOL skeleton program. Sequential in, sequential out.

#### COBOL VSAM Processing - Batch

- **[ESDS1.cbl](ESDS1.cbl)**. Sample batch COBOL program to process VSAM ESDS files.

- **[KSDS1.cbl](KSDS1.cbl)**. Sample batch COBOL program to process VSAM KSDS files.

- **[RRDS1.cbl](RRDS1.cbl)**. Sample batch COBOL program to process VSAM RRDS files.

#### COBOL Strings and Text

- **[STRING5.cbl](STRING5.cbl)**. A sample program that demonstrates several COBOL features, including group and elementary Data Division entries, REDEFINES, RENAMES, MOVE CORRESPONDING, Reference Modification, IF/ELSE, and EVALUATE.

- **[STRING6.cbl](STRING6.cbl)**. A sample program that demonstrates using combinations of STRING, UNSTRING, INSPECT, and intrinsic functions to manipulate text.

- **[UNSTRING.cbl](UNSTRING.cbl)**. A sample program that demonstrates all the options of the UNSTRING statement.

#### COBOL Numeric Data Formats, Arithmetic, Dates

- **[NUMBERS1.cbl](NUMBERS1.cbl)**. A sample program that demonstrates numeric data formats and the ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, and COMPUTE statements as well as several intrinsic functions applicable to arithmetic.

- **[DATES.cbl](DATES.cbl)**. A sample program that demonstrates date and time handling.

#### COBOL Tables

- **[TABLES.cbl](TABLES.cbl)**. A sample program that demonstrates basic table definition and manipulation.

#### COBOL Subprograms

- **[LEAP1.cbl](LEAP1.cbl)**. A sample program that demonstrates a static subprogram CALL that passes parameters BY REFERENCE.

- **[LEAP2.cbl](LEAP2.cbl)**. A sample program that demonstrates a static subprogram CALL that passes parameters BY CONTENT.

- **[LEAP3.cbl](LEAP3.cbl)**. A sample program that demonstrates a dynamic subprogram CALL.

- **[ISLEAP1.cbl](LEAP1.cbl)**. A sample subprogram that expects parameters to be passed BY REFERENCE.

- **[ISLEAP2.cbl](LEAP2.cbl)**. A sample subprogram that expects parameters to be passed BY CONTENT.

- **[ISLEAP3.cbl](LEAP2.cbl)**. A sample subprogram that expects parameters to be passed BY CONTENT, with a different implementation of the logic, to help demonstrate dynamic subprogram calls.
